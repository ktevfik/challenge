# Solve at least one problem a day challenge

I solve often algorithm and data structure problems for practicing.

But I am trying some alternatives to gain more practice in problem solving.

That's why I challenge myself to solve a problem every day until graduation.

I will be using Java and C++

Just Leetcode.
